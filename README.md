# MNIST - Web application for image classification model

In this project, a Deep Learning model was built for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. The model was created in Keras and at
the end of the training it was saved in JSON format.

Next, a web application was created in Python. The application is processed via a browser with Flask.
